A new Flutter application.

## Introduction

I used Flutter as my Cross Development Platform. The reasoning behind that is i feel more comfortable using Flutter compared to other Cross Development Platforms. Also Flutter is using one codebase to produce both Android and IOS applications so i believe that is a good convenience.

This app contains 4 screens : Category Screen , Favorite Screen , Food Screen and Cart Screen respectively. I used Online JSON Database to mock the data and get the food information. I used Hive package from flutter.dev to store cart and favorite information. I also used provider package to pass the data along the screens and widgets. 

I believe that the code can be stronger and more dynamic to use. I think that is the most important improvement can be done for this project.
